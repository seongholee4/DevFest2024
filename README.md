# CivicHeart
### Hackathon: DevFest 2024 Hosted by Columbia University

## What It Does: 
**Helps voters be more aware of their local elections and politics, specifically in New York City by providing services such as:**
- Allowing users to type in their ZIP code to find their councilmember
- Allowing users to search for what legislation is currently being discussed that falls in their interest of categories
- Allowing users to express their like or dislike of a proposal through voting

## Front End
- Uses Expo Go as a development server
- Design planning and prototypes are made with Figma

## Back End
1. Navigate the terminal into `/server`
2. Run `npm install` to install all Node dependencies
3. Requires ".env" file information
```
REACT_APP_MONGODB_KEY = mongodb+srv://devfest24:devfest24@devfest24.nkeqmxs.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
3. Run `node server.js` to begin the connection to the MongoDB database.
